# network-auth
Linux PAM authentication for familiar networks

 This is a PAM Module written in Python that allows for authentication
 when connected to a familiar network. It mimics Android's Smart Lock.
 It is not intended for use as a sole authentication method
 or as a required module with no backup method of authentication.

Install this program on Ubuntu 18.04 (or later) by running the following commands in the terminal:
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jahess/network-auth
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install network-auth
```
